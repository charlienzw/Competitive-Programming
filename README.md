## Time Complexity
Generally, the limit time is 1s. In order to comform this, we must design algorithms of specific time complexity to input size.  

| Time Complexity   |      Input Size      |  Maximum Size |
|-------------------|:--------------------:|--------------:|
|      O(logN)      |       >>10^20        |   Very Large  |
|      O(N^1/2)     |       10^12          |   10^14       |
|      O(N)         |       10^6           |   10^7        |
|      O(NlogN)     |       10^5           |   10^6        |
|      O(N^2)       |       1000           |   2500        |
|      O(N^3)       |       100            |   500         |
|      O(N^4)       |       50             |   50          |
|      O(2^N)       |       20             |   20          |
|      O(N!)        |       9              |   10          |
